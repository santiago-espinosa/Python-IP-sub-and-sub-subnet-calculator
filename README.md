# Python IP sub and sub-subnet calculator

This script takes three arguments: starting and ending IPs, and number of batches.
It generates files with one IP per line where the starting and ending IPs are the ones given.

## Usage:

#### Batches: 

Number of files that this script should generate. Each batch has the normal IP range (0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255)
and will require the input of starting and ending IPs

#### Starting and ending IPs:
IP where the file should start and end. 
	
	
## Example:
	IP Address Target File Creator
	Ver: 0.1
	Number of Batches to create:

1

	Batch 1 STARTING IP:

127.0.0.0

	Batch 1 ENDING IP:

127.0.0.255

	Done. IP list(s) in script directory under name "Batch_XX.txt"
